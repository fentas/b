**b** is a modern binary manager designed to simplify how developers install, manage, and version their command-line tools.

## Purpose

`b` was created to solve the common problems developers face when managing development tools across different projects and environments:

- **Version Conflicts**: Different projects requiring different tool versions
- **Environment Setup**: Complex installation and PATH management
- **Team Consistency**: Ensuring all team members use the same tool versions
- **CI/CD Integration**: Reproducible builds with exact tool dependencies

## Open Source

`b` is an open-source project available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fentas/b). We welcome contributions from the community.

This documentation is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and uses design elements inspired by the [Medusa](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa) project.
