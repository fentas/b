# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the **b** documentation.

## B

**b** - A modern binary manager for developers that simplifies installation, versioning, and management of command-line tools.

**.bin/b.yaml** - The configuration file that defines binary dependencies for a project, typically located in the `.bin` directory. Contains version specifications and metadata.

**Binary** - An executable command-line tool managed by **b** (e.g., `jq`, `kubectl`, `terraform`).

**Binary Manager** - A tool that automates the installation, versioning, and PATH management of command-line utilities.

## C

**CLI** - Command Line Interface. The text-based interface used to interact with **b**.

**Configuration Discovery** - The process by which **b** automatically locates and loads the nearest `.bin/b.yaml` file in the directory hierarchy.

**Context-Aware** - **b**'s ability to automatically detect and use project-specific configurations without explicit file paths.

## D

**Dependency Management** - The process of managing tool versions and ensuring consistent environments across different systems.

**Download Cache** - Local storage where **b** keeps downloaded binaries to avoid re-downloading.

## E

**Environment Isolation** - Keeping project-specific tool versions separate from system-wide installations.

**Executable** - A binary file that can be run as a command.

## G

**GitHub Releases** - The source from which **b** downloads most binaries, using GitHub's release API.

**Global Installation** - Installing **b** system-wide, making it available to all users.

## I

**Installation Path** - The directory where **b** installs and manages binaries (typically `~/.local/share/b/bin/`).

**Isolation** - Keeping different projects' tool versions separate to avoid conflicts.

## P

**PATH** - The environment variable that tells the shell where to find executable programs.

**PATH Management** - **b**'s automatic handling of adding managed binaries to the system PATH.

**Project-Based Configuration** - Using `.bin/b.yaml` files to define tool requirements specific to individual projects.

## S

**Subcommand** - A secondary command that follows the main **b** command (e.g., `install`, `update`, `list`).

**Symlink** - A symbolic link that points to the actual binary location, used for PATH management.

## V

**Version Constraint** - Specifications in **b.yaml** that define which version of a tool to use (e.g., `"1.6"`, `"latest"`).

**Version Resolution** - The process of determining which specific version to install based on constraints.

**Versioning** - Managing different versions of the same tool for different projects or requirements.
