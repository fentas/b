# Getting Started with b

Get up and running with **b** in just a few minutes. **b** helps you manage command-line tools and binaries for your development projects with automatic PATH management and version control.

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Install b
curl -sSL https://github.com/fentas/b/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# Or using wget
wget -qO- https://github.com/fentas/b/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fentas/b/releases)
2. Extract the binary to a directory in your PATH
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x b`

### Verify Installation

```bash
b version
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-project

# Initialize b configuration
b init
```

This creates a `b.yaml` file in your project root.

### 2. Install Tools

```bash
# Install specific versions
b install jq@jq-1.7 kubectl@v1.28.0

# Install latest versions
b install terraform helm

# Install and add to b.yaml
b install --add docker-compose@v2.20.0
```

### 3. Use Your Tools

Tools are automatically available in your PATH:

```bash
jq --version     # jq-1.7
kubectl version  # v1.28.0
```

## Common Workflows

### Team Collaboration

Share tool requirements with your team:

```bash
# Add tools to b.yaml
b install --add jq@jq-1.7 kubectl@v1.28.0

# Commit b.yaml to version control
git add .bin/b.yaml
git commit -m "Add project tool requirements"

# Team members can install the same tools
b install  # Installs all tools from b.yaml
```

### CI/CD Integration

Use **b** in your CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: Install b
    # todo: wrong url; create install script
    run: curl -sSL https://github.com/fentas/b/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
  - name: Install project tools
    run: b install
  - name: Run tests
    run: |
      kubectl version --client
      jq --version
```

### Version Management

```bash
# List configured tools and their status
b list

# Update all tools to latest versions
b update

# Update specific tools
b update kubectl

# Search for available tools
b search terraform
```

## Configuration

The `.bin/b.yaml` file defines your project's tool requirements:

```yaml
binaries:
  jq:
    version: "jq-1.7"
  kubectl:
    version: "v1.28.0"
  # leave empty for latest version
  terraform:
```
