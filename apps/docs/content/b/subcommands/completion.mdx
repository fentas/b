## Shell-Specific Notes

### Bash

For better completion experience with bash, consider installing the `bash-completion` package:

```bash

brew install bash-completion

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install bash-completion
```

### Zsh

If you're using Oh My Zsh, the completion should work out of the box after installation.
