## Installation

To use shell completion, you need to generate the script for your shell and source it.

### Bash

Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:

```bash
# Bash completion for b CLI
source <(b completion bash)
```

For a better completion experience with bash, consider installing the `bash-completion` package:

```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install bash-completion

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install bash-completion
```

### Zsh

Add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
# Zsh completion for b CLI
if [ $commands[b] ]; then
  source <(b completion zsh)
fi
```

If you're using Oh My Zsh, the completion should work out of the box after installation.

### Fish

Save the completion script to your Fish completions directory:

```bash
# Create completions directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions

# Generate and save completion script
b completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/b.fish
```

### PowerShell

Add the following to your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`):

```powershell
# PowerShell completion for b CLI
b completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

## Examples

### Generate and Save Completion Script

```bash
# Generate bash completion script and save it
b completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/b

# Generate zsh completion script for Oh My Zsh
b completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_b"
```

### Use in Current Session

For a single session without modifying your shell configuration:

```bash
# Bash/Zsh
source <(b completion bash)

# Fish
b completion fish | source
```
