# Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues you might encounter when using **b** and their solutions.

## Installation Issues

### Permission Denied

**Problem**: Getting permission denied errors during installation.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Make sure you have write permissions to the installation directory
# https://github.com/fentas/b/releases/latest/download/install.sh
sudo curl -sSL https://get.binary.help | bash

# Or install to a user directory
# https://github.com/fentas/b/releases/latest/download/install.sh
curl -sSL https://get.binary.help | bash -s -- --prefix=$HOME/.local
```

### Command Not Found

**Problem**: `b: command not found` after installation.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Add b to your PATH
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Or for zsh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Configuration Issues

### .bin/b.yaml Not Found

**Problem**: `configuration file not found`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Initialize b in your project directory
cd your-project
b init

# Or create .bin/b.yaml manually
mkdir -p .bin
cat > .bin/b.yaml << EOF
binaries: {}
EOF
```

### Invalid Configuration

**Problem**: YAML parsing errors in `.bin/b.yaml`

**Solution**:
```bash
# Validate your YAML syntax
# Check for proper indentation and structure
cat .bin/b.yaml

# Example valid format:
binaries:
  jq:
    version: "1.7"
  kubectl:
    version: "1.28.0"
```

## Binary Installation Issues

### Download Failures

**Problem**: Failed to download binary from GitHub releases

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check your internet connection
curl -I https://github.com

# Check GitHub API rate limits
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" https://api.github.com/rate_limit

# If you are using a proxy, make sure your shell environment is configured correctly
# (e.g., HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY environment variables).
```

### Version Not Found

**Problem**: Specified version doesn't exist

**Solution**:
```bash
# Search for available versions
b search jq

# Use 'latest' for the most recent version
b install jq@latest

# Check the project's GitHub releases page
```

### Binary Not Executable

**Problem**: Installed binary is not executable

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check binary permissions
ls -la ~/.local/share/b/bin/

# Make executable if needed
chmod +x ~/.local/share/b/bin/jq

# Reinstall the binary
b install --force jq
```

## PATH and Environment Issues

### Tools Not Available

**Problem**: Installed tools are not available in PATH

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check if b's bin directory is in PATH
echo $PATH | grep -o '[^:]*b[^:]*'

# Source your shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc

# Check b's configuration
b list
```

### Conflicting Versions

**Problem**: System version conflicts with b-managed version

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check which version is being used
which jq
jq --version

# Ensure b's bin directory comes first in PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/b/bin:$PATH"

# Update your shell configuration
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/b/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Performance Issues

### Slow Downloads

**Problem**: Binary downloads are very slow

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Use a different mirror or CDN if available
# Check your network connection
speedtest-cli

# Try downloading during off-peak hours
# Consider using a VPN if geographical restrictions apply
```

### Large Git Cache

**Problem**: **b**'s git cache directory is taking up too much space

**Solution**:
```bash
# Check cache location and size
b cache path
du -sh $(b cache path)

# Clean the cache
b cache clean
```

## Env File Sync Issues

### Clone Failures

**Problem**: `git clone` or `git fetch` fails when syncing env files

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check connectivity to the remote
git ls-remote https://github.com/org/repo

# Clean the cache and retry
b cache clean
b update

# Ensure git is installed and SSH keys / credentials are configured
```

### Merge Conflicts

**Problem**: `b update --strategy=merge` reports conflicts

**Solution**:
```bash
# Conflicts are marked with standard conflict markers in the file
# Open the conflicting file and resolve manually, then re-run:
b update

# Or use 'replace' to overwrite local changes
b update --strategy=replace

# Or use 'client' to keep your local version
b update --strategy=client
```

### Env Destination Conflicts

**Problem**: Two env entries write to the same destination file

**Solution**:
```yaml
# Use distinct 'dest' values in b.yaml to avoid overlap
envs:
  github.com/org/infra:
    files:
      manifests/base/**:
        dest: infra-base/
  github.com/org/overrides:
    files:
      override/**:
        dest: override-base/
```

### Verify Mismatches

**Problem**: `b verify` reports sha256 mismatches

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check what changed locally
b verify

# Re-sync to restore upstream state
b update --strategy=replace

# Or if you want to keep local changes, update the lock
b update --strategy=client
```

## CI/CD Issues

### GitHub Actions Failures

**Problem**: **b** installation fails in GitHub Actions

**Solution**:
```yaml
# Use specific version and add error handling
steps:
  - name: Install b
    run: |
      curl -sSL https://get.binary.help | bash
      echo "$HOME/.local/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
  
  - name: Verify b installation
    run: b version
  
  - name: Install project tools
    run: b install
```

### Docker Container Issues

**Problem**: **b** doesn't work properly in Docker containers

**Solution**:
```dockerfile
# Install b in Dockerfile
RUN curl -sSL https://get.binary.help | bash
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Or use multi-stage build
FROM alpine AS b-installer
RUN apk add --no-cache curl
RUN curl -sSL https://get.binary.help | bash

FROM alpine
COPY --from=b-installer /root/.local/bin/b /usr/local/bin/b
```
