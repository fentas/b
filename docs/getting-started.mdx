# Getting Started with b

Get up and running with **b** in just a few minutes. **b** helps you manage command-line tools and binaries for your development projects with automatic PATH management and version control.

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Install b
curl -sSL https://github.com/fentas/b/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# Or using wget
wget -qO- https://github.com/fentas/b/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fentas/b/releases)
2. Extract the binary to a directory in your PATH
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x b`

### Verify Installation

```bash
b version
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a Project

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-project

# Initialize b configuration
b init
```

This creates a `b.yaml` file in your project root.

### 2. Install Tools

```bash
# Install specific versions
b install jq@jq-1.7 kubectl@v1.28.0

# Install latest versions
b install terraform helm

# Install and add to b.yaml
b install --add docker-compose@v2.20.0
```

### 3. Use Your Tools

Tools are automatically available in your PATH:

```bash
jq --version     # jq-1.7
kubectl version  # v1.28.0
```

## Common Workflows

### Team Collaboration

Share tool requirements with your team:

```bash
# Add tools to b.yaml
b install --add jq@jq-1.7 kubectl@v1.28.0

# Commit b.yaml to version control
git add .bin/b.yaml
git commit -m "Add project tool requirements"

# Team members can install the same tools
b install  # Installs all tools from b.yaml
```

### CI/CD Integration

Use **b** in your CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: Install b
    # todo: wrong url; create install script
    run: curl -sSL https://github.com/fentas/b/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
  - name: Install project tools
    run: b install
  - name: Run tests
    run: |
      kubectl version --client
      jq --version
```

### Version Management

```bash
# List configured tools and their status
b list

# Update all tools to latest versions
b update

# Update specific tools
b update kubectl

# Search for available tools
b search terraform
```

## Configuration

The `.bin/b.yaml` file defines your project's tool requirements:

```yaml
binaries:
  jq:
    version: "jq-1.7"
  kubectl:
    version: "v1.28.0"
  # leave empty for latest version
  terraform:
  # alias: install one binary under a different name
  envsubst:
    alias: renvsubst
  # custom file paths
  custom-kubectl:
    file: ../bin/kubectl  # relative to config file
  system-tool:
    file: /usr/local/bin/tool  # absolute path
```

### Binary Aliases

You can create aliases for binaries using the `alias` field. This installs one binary but makes it available under a different name:

```yaml
binaries:
  # This installs 'renvsubst' but makes it available as 'envsubst'
  envsubst:
    alias: renvsubst
  # You can combine alias with version constraints
  myenvsubst:
    alias: renvsubst
    version: "v0.10.0"
```

Aliases are useful when:
- You want to use a standard name for a tool that has a different actual name
- You need multiple versions of the same tool with different names
- You want to maintain compatibility with existing scripts while using a different implementation

### Custom File Paths

You can specify custom file paths for binaries using the `file` field. This allows you to:
- Point to existing binaries on your system
- Specify custom installation locations
- Use binaries from different directories

```yaml
binaries:
  # Relative paths are resolved relative to the config file location
  kubectl:
    file: ../bin/kubectl
    version: "v1.28.0"
  
  # Absolute paths are used as-is
  custom-tool:
    file: /usr/local/bin/custom-tool
  
  # Combine with other options
  my-jq:
    file: ./tools/jq
    version: "jq-1.7"
    alias: jq
```

**Path Resolution:**
- **Relative paths** (like `../bin/tool` or `./tools/binary`) are resolved relative to the config file's directory
- **Absolute paths** (like `/usr/local/bin/tool`) are used exactly as specified (mind the permissions)
- This feature is particularly useful for pointing to pre-existing binaries or organizing tools in custom directory structures
